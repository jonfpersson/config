# My personal configs
Keeping track of my different configuration files for different tools across different platforms is hard, therefore I have created this repository with the intent of storing the files.

## Tmux
I have quite different binds than the default ones, if you wish to check them out simply look at ```tmux.conf```

## Oh my Zsh
My terminal configuration, complete with different plugins and themes.

## Alacritty
Configuration for opening tmux correctly and some light theme settings.

## Alacritty Set-up
If you want to know how to set this up, I recommend you to check of my blag at https://jonfpersson.github.io/Code-Crust
